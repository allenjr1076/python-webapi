#summary Roadmap for python-webapi development.

== Oauth2 and HTTPS support ==

Many APIs support the oauth2 protocol for user authentication. It would be nice to offer a simple interface for authorizing a WebApi instance to a specific site user. HTTPS support should be added before user authentication to promote security.

{{{
api = WebApi("https://my.secure.site/api/", appkey="my_appkey")
api._authorize("username", "user_authtoken")
## do stuff with the api
api._deauthorize()
}}}


== API Definitions ==

It is often the case that APIs don't follow the same url call, query list, and http method paradigms. It would be nice to allow user configuration of more complicated APIs through a simple config file (kind of like a model definition). Programmers could write their own definitions for non-standard APIs. Sites offering APIs could also provide API definitions for developers (pragmatic API docs).
Adding API definition files would also give developers a mechanism to alias longer API calls (or api calls that contain illegal characters [like the '-']) to shorter method names.


== Python 3 support ==

Support python 3.
